# DatoJi

A FREE RESTful HTTP based JSON API. It lets you create, read, update, delete and search JSON data over HTTP APIs. Ideal for small hobbies projects, MVP or just for fun, where you don't need to create your personal data storage.


## Schema

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from https://datoji.dev. All data is sent and received as JSON.

Blank fields are included as null instead of being omitted.

All timestamps return in ISO 8601 format:

``` ruby
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
```

All responses follow the [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/format/) guidelines:

JSON:API is a specification for how a client should request that resources be fetched or modified, and how a server should respond to those requests.

JSON:API is designed to minimize both the number of requests and the amount of data transmitted between clients and servers. This efficiency is achieved without compromising readability, flexibility, or discoverability.

```
{
  "data": {
    "type": "entry",
    "id": "1",
    "attributes": {
      // ... this entry's attributes
    },
    "relationships": {
      // ... this entry's relationships
    }
  }
}
```

## Pagination

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 20 items by default. You can specify further pages with the ```?page``` parameter. Pagination information is available inside **headers**. Example:

```
Current-Page: 1
Per-Page: 20
Link:<https://datoji.dev/packs/{PACK_ID}/entries?page=1>; rel="first", <https://datoji.dev/packs/{PACK_ID}/entries?page=24>; rel="last"
Total: 464
```

## Documentation

**Authentication**

API uses OAuth 2.0 token for user authorization and API authentication. Applications must be authorized and authenticated before they can fetch data.

    
```sh

curl -X POST 'https://datoji.dev/tokens' -H 'content-type: application/json'

```


```json

{
  "data": {
    "id": "b14e1665-5ab3-4b71-a669-b6280d64147e",
    "type": "token",
    "attributes": {
      "key": "uBrcpRP3QVgEJeuffuENPeSc2ObAaGoO",
      "created_at": "2020-06-12T12:51:18.971Z"
    }
  }
}

```

**Note**

You must use `Authorization: Token 80-Pk8MtTMLXT_ThBaCDuDtF1eTyVmQj` header for ALL requests.

## CRUD PACKS

A Pack is a container of all the entries. Before you can create the entries you must create the container to get the **ID** with which you can make the calls.

```sh

curl -X POST 'https://datoji.dev/packs' -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Token {KEY}'
    
```
### Body

## CRUD ENTRY

**Create**

```sh

curl -X POST 'https://datoji.dev/{PACK_ID}/entries' \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Token {KEY}' \
    -d '{ "entry": { "repo": "davidesantangelo/datoji", "private": false, "stargazers_count": 0 } }'
    
```

```json

{
  "data": {

```sh

curl -X POST 'https://datoji.dev/{PACK_ID}/entries/bulk' \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Token {KEY}' \
    -d '{ "entries": [{ "repo": "davidesantangelo/datoji" },{ "repo": "davidesantangelo/tuns" },{ "repo": "davidesantangelo/emailhunter" }]}'
    
```

The result in case of success is an array of IDs.

```
[
  "6403b952-ce7d-4759-96d9-c8a913e166ec",
  "5993d6b2-16cd-4d78-a7c8-2aba0f27af0d",
  "b5861049-7c4d-485d-b795-669b9578b78d"
]
```

**Read**

Use HTTP GET to read all the records or a single record.


You can also specify a param **&order=[asc/desc]** by *created_at* field. Can be one of asc or desc. Default: desc.


```sh

curl -X GET 'https://datoji.dev/packs/{PACK_ID}/entries' -H 'Authorization: Token {KEY}'

```

**Delete**

To delete a specific record use HTTP DELETE, you will receive in case of success a *204 No Content* code.

```sh

curl -X DELETE 'https://datoji.dev/packs/{PACK_ID}/entries/{ENTRY_ID}' -H 'Authorization: Token {KEY}'

```
## Search

You can perform searches within the dataset.

Supporting:

- unquoted text: text not inside quote marks will be converted to terms separated by & operators, as if processed by plainto_tsquery.

- "quoted text": text inside quote marks will be converted to terms separated by <-> operators, as if processed by phraseto_tsquery.

- OR: logical or will be converted to the | operator.

- -: the logical not operator, converted to the the ! operator.


```sh

curl -X GET 'https://datoji.dev/packs/{PACK_ID}/search?q=datoji' -H 'Authorization: Token {KEY}'

```

```json

{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "b858bf82-1abf-4cb0-a9e0-2a59f1b7f30d",
      "type": "entry",
      "attributes": {
        "data": {
          "repo": "davidesantangelo/datoji",
          "private": true,
          "stargazers_count": 10
        }
        "created_at": "2020-06-11T14:37:08.293Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-06-11T14:37:08.293Z"

        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
